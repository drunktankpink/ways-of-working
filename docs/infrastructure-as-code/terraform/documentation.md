# Documentation

All modules or deployments of Terraform should contain documentation that explains the purpose or describes usage of resources. This is usually in the form of a `README` within each directory/repository.

## Terraform-docs

[Terraform-docs](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/introduction/) is a utility which can be used to automate the generation of documentation files for each terraform deployment.<br>
The website contains a guide on how to [install](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/installation/), as well as how to use the utility via CLI, GitHub actions or via pre-commit hook.
